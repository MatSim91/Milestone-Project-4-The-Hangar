## Bugs and Fixes

1. After adding the search functionality every time I was searching for anything it was displaying all the products.
	- 1.1 **Fix:** The indendation of both lines (lines followed below) was wrong. I have to remove one indendation level: 
    ```
            queries = Q(name__icontains=query) | Q(description__icontains=query)
            products = products.filter(queries)
    ```

2. After adding the search functionality for product types the server was running fine and not showing any error, but everytime I selecting the product type like "Jets" on the navbar it wasn't showing anything.
    - 2.1 **Fix:** I have to add a Friendly name to models.py so while selecting the type on navbar would retrieve the type name all in lowercase and show the friendly name with the first letter capitalized.

3. While trying to setup webhook I got a few 401 errors while trying to send a test event to a webhook endpoint. While investigating it better I have found out that this error was related to an Unauthorized request.
    - 3.1 **Fix:** The 8000 port was set to private and while checking Slack I have found out that the 8000 port must be set to public. After changing the 8000 port to public I was still getting a 401 error and this time was due to the URL added in stripe not containing the 8000 port on the URL (https://8000-coffee-mongoose-wi4a85v2.ws-eu18.gitpod.io/checkout/wh/).

4. After I deleted a product on Django Admin panel to perform a test the entire website started returning a 404 with the error message `RelatedObjectDoesNotExist at /admin/login/`
    - 4.1 **Fix:** After trying several times to close and start the python server and also shutting off and opening again the workspace on gitpod I found that the issue was with the session cookies. After clearing all the cookies I manage to see the website again without the products that I have deleted.

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages 

**Under the repository page:**

    1. Click on Settings 
    2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section 
    3. Select the Source Branch 
    4. Click Save.

- For this project, I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

    1. I started the project by creating a new Repository on GitHub and loading the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

    2. Installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) and on my GitHub repo I clicked on the Gitpod button to create a new Master Workspace on GitPod.

    3. After creating the workspace I developed the website using Gitpod and pushing my commits to GitHub using the following commands:
        - `git add "file-name"` - To add a file for staging.
        - `git commit -m "description-of-update"` - To commit.
        - `git push` - To push my commits to GitHub
        - I have also used extra git commands such as: 
        - `python3 -m http.server` - To run a preview of the website on the browser.
        - `git status` - To display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.

## Heroku

- To deploy the app using Heroku, go through the following steps:

    1. Use pip3 freeze > `requirements.txt` to create a list of the dependencies.

    2. Create a `Procfile` by running this command on the CLI: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

    3. Run `git add .`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`, to push the project files to your GitHub repository.

    4. Navigate to Heroku, log in and create a new app by clicking on the 'New' and 'Create New App'. Enter your app name and select your region and create app.

    5. Under the 'Deploy' tab, select 'GitHub - Connect to GitHub'.
    
    6. Enter your repository's name in the input field, and connect once found.

    7. To set your environment variables navigate to the 'Settings' tab and scroll down to 'reveal config vars'

    8. Add the config vars:

    | Key | Value |
    |:---:|:-----:|
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | MONGO_DBNAME | `<database_name>` |
    | MONGO_URI | `` |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<Your secret Key>` |

    9. Navigate to the 'Deploy' tab. To enable automatic deployment, scroll down to the 'Automatic Deploys' section.

    10. Choose your GitHub branch and enable automatic deployment.
