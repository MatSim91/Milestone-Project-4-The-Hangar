# Deployment

## GitHub Pages 

**Under the repository page:**

    1. Click on Settings 
    2. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section 
    3. Select the Source Branch 
    4. Click Save.

- For this project, I have used the cloud-based IDE [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) and [GitHub](http://github.com/) as a free git repository hosting.

    1. I started the project by creating a new Repository on GitHub and loading the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).

    2. Installed the [Gitpod extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki) and on my GitHub repo I clicked on the Gitpod button to create a new Master Workspace on GitPod.

    3. After creating the workspace I developed the website using Gitpod and pushing my commits to GitHub using the following commands:
        - `git add "file-name"` - To add a file for staging.
        - `git commit -m "description-of-update"` - To commit.
        - `git push` - To push my commits to GitHub
        - I have also used extra git commands such as: 
        - `python3 -m http.server` - To run a preview of the website on the browser.
        - `git status` - To display the current state of the working directory and the staging area.

## Heroku

- To deploy the app using Heroku, go through the following steps:

    1. Use pip3 freeze > `requirements.txt` to create a list of the dependencies.

    2. Create a `Procfile` by running this command on the CLI: `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

    3. Run `git add .`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`, to push the project files to your GitHub repository.

    4. Navigate to Heroku, log in and create a new app by clicking on the 'New' and 'Create New App'. Enter your app name and select your region and create app.

    5. Under the 'Deploy' tab, select 'GitHub - Connect to GitHub'.
    
    6. Enter your repository's name in the input field, and connect once found.

    7. To set your environment variables navigate to the 'Settings' tab and scroll down to 'reveal config vars'

    8. Add the config vars:

    | Key | Value |
    |:---:|:-----:|
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | MONGO_DBNAME | `<database_name>` |
    | MONGO_URI | `` |
    | SECRET_KEY | `<Your secret Key>` |

    9. Navigate to the 'Deploy' tab. To enable automatic deployment, scroll down to the 'Automatic Deploys' section.

    10. Choose your GitHub branch and enable automatic deployment.
